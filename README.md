Grid_PRO is a specialized definitions package for Grasshopper (Rhino) tailored specifically for the development of active-bending timber gridshells.
This comprehensive toolkit streamlines the complex workflow associated with these structures, integrating the entire process from conception to construction. Key functionalities include:
 Design: Parametric tools for form-finding and generating the complex, double-curved geometries typical of elastically bent grids.
 Analysis: Integrated utilities for preliminary structural analysis, allowing designers to understand and optimize the material behavior and forces within the active-bending system.
 Fabrication: Automation of manufacturing outputs, generating the necessary documents required for the precise fabrication of the timber components.
